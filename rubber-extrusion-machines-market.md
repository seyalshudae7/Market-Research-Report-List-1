<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rubber Extrusion Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cold Feed Rubber Extruder</li><li>Hot Feed Rubber Extruder</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rubber extrusion machines market is primarily divided into two types: cold feed rubber extruders and hot feed rubber extruders. Cold feed extruders utilize unprocessed rubber, which is fed directly into the machine at ambient temperatures, suitable for producing complex shapes and maintaining material integrity. Hot feed extruders, on the other hand, involve heating the rubber before extrusion, allowing for better flow and shaping but may alter material properties. Both types cater to different manufacturing needs in the rubber industry.</p></p>
