<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dual Line Distributors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>One-way Output</li><li>Two-way Output</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dual Line Distributors operate in two distinct market types: One-way Output and Two-way Output. In a One-way Output market, the distributor purchases products from manufacturers and sells them directly to retailers or customers, with a linear flow of goods without returns. Conversely, a Two-way Output market allows for interaction in both directions, where products can be sold to customers and returns or unsold goods can be sent back to the distributor or manufacturer, facilitating a more flexible inventory management system.</p></p>
