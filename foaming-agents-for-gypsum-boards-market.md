<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Foaming Agents for Gypsum Boards Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Stable Foaming Agents</li><li>Unstable Foaming Agents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the gypsum board market, foaming agents are categorized into two main types: stable and unstable foaming agents. Stable foaming agents create a durable foam structure, maintaining air bubbles throughout the drying process, which enhances the board's insulation and lightweight properties. In contrast, unstable foaming agents produce temporary foam that collapses quickly, often used for specific applications where rapid drying is needed. Both types play crucial roles in determining the performance and characteristics of gypsum boards, including strength and fire resistance.</p></p>
